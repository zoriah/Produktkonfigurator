      The $ is a convention that indicates heroes$ is an Observable, not an array.
      The *ngFor can't do anything with an Observable. 
      But there's also a pipe character (|) followed by async, which identifies Angular's AsyncPipe.
      The AsyncPipe subscribes to an Observable automatically 
      so you won't have to do so in the component class.
